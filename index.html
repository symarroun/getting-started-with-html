  <h1> Introduction to Programming </h1>
<body>
As a beginner in programming, it is important to understand the available resources, tools and software and how they all relate to each other. For example, what is Python, and how is it related to HTML? well, what does HTML stand for? and so forth.
In the programming world, there are plenty of concepts that <b>seem</b> to most people as seperate concepts. However, they are connected in one way or another. Some of those concepts are the user, browser, internet, http, and the servers. What is each one has to do with the other? Well, each part is in one way or another is an essential component for the full convinient experience of the internet surfing. 
The user uses the browser to interact with web-based application. The browser displays the data available on the internet
<br> Here is an image showing the interaction flow: <br>

<h2> Thinking Lenses </h2>
<p>
As a programmer, you have to develop specific thinking lenses that you will alternate between as you are creating your code. Each len has its advantages for each stage of the coding process. The lenses are as follow:
<br>
<h3>1. Procedural Thinking</h3> <br>
Like saying, (1) ..., (2) ..., (3) ..., and so on. <br>
<br>
<h3>2. Abstract Thinking</h3> <br>
Like saying, 1 + 1 = 2 <br>
<br>
<h3>3. Systematic Debugging</h3> <br>
Like saying, The problem is ..., and the possible causes coule be ... <br>
<br>
<h3>4. Technological Empathy </h3><br>
This is the lens where the user get to understand how the computer sees things. <br>
<br>
<h3>5. Systems Thinking</h3> <br>
This is the most important lens. This lens helps breaking down big ideas into component pieces.

<h2> Helpful Tools </h2>
<p> 
There are plenty of tools out there that could be used to make both the learning process easier as well as the advanced coding process. Some the best tools out there as a learner are <a href="scratchpad.io">ScratchPad.io</a>, and <a href="codepen.io">CodePen.io</a>
</p>

<h3> ScratchPad </h3> 
    This is a great tool for learners. It is an online based tool which display how the code looks like as you are coding. I have been using it, and it's awesome!
<h3> CodePen </h3>
    CodePen is similar to ScratchPad but with more features. Check this both.

<h2>Terms</h2>
  <b> HTML Element: </b> <br> 
  Elements types are indicated by HTML tags. Tags are written like this < > and a letter in between indicating what tag it is. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag; Except some element like the ones for an image <img>. The element without closing tags are referred to as an element with a void tag. <br>
  Elements are divided in two main categories: <b>Inline </b> and <b> Block</b>. <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline Elements: a, span, br, img, strong </li>
    <li> Block elements: div, p, form </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <b> Web Page:</b> <br>
        A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
  <br>
  <b> World Wide Web (WWW) </b> <br>
        The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of HTML documents which are connected through this web.
  <br>
  

<h3> Tags </h3>
<p>
Keep in mind that if a tag is not closed, everything after the tag is activated by that tag. Yes, computers are stupid. They do exactly what <b> YOU </b> tell them to do. Thus, be careful about how you communicate with a computer and understand how it understands you :).
<br>
  <ul>
    <li><xmp><i> & <em> : Both make the content italics. However, emphasis <em> is becoming more pupolar for advanced coding reasons </xmp></li>
    <li><xmp><b> & <strong> : bold vs. strong, they both bold the word. </xmp></li>
  
  </ul>

<h2>  HTML Elements Attributes</h2>
Some elements requires attribues to be added within a tag. For example, an images needs to be directed to its source and a link (URL) should be referenced to its URL link. The attribute is included in the opening tag in this form: <br>
< a href="URL" > Content </a>. In other words, an element with an attribute with have the following components: Within the opening tag (an attribute name, a value), and content followed by a closing tag where appropriate.


</p>

<h2> Last Notes </h2>
1. The <b> WhiteSpace </b> in the coding side has no effect on the output in the display screen for users. <br>
2. <strong>Write comments within a code script</strong> is helpful for you when you look back at your code as well as for anyone else who might be looking at your code. This can be done by typing your comment in the following format: <br>
      <xmp><!-- comment--> </xmp>

<h2> Typical Document Structure </h2>
      <xmp><! Doctype HTML></xmp>
        <xmp><html></xmp>
          <xmp><head></xmp>
            <xmp><title>TheTitle</title></xmp>
          <xmp></head></xmp>
          
          <xmp><body></xmp>
            The Content along with its elements and tags
          <xmp></body></xmp>
        <xmp></html></xmp>
